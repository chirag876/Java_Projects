**The Brick Breaker Game In Java is made up of bricks that are aligned at the top of the screen. The player uses a ball to hit the bricks with help of a rectangle shaped platform and after hitting each brick the player gets the score. The arrow keys are used to move the platform on the screen from left to right.**

**For creating a digital clock I used JFrame JLabel and Timer class from the Swing framework. The JFrame class is used to construct a top level window for clock. The JLabel class is used to display a string and the Timer class is used to fire events at specified intervals.**
